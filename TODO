Important:

New features:

* "oneof" expressions.  Including the "|" syntax.

* Regex expressions.  Parsing those out of the phrase configs will be fun.
  Update expression syntax section of README.md when done.

* Multiple possible tags in tag expressions?

* Support "(TAG)" syntax.

* Implement (pos) expression type for ' and 's.

Correctness:

* List the possible Penn tags for checking tag expression arguments (ie, the tag
  the user wants to filter on) in TagEvaluator.

* Multi-token expressions.  Internally preprocess the precomputable expressions
  to generate normal single-token expressions.  Needed for some possessive
  personal edge cases to work.  Example:

      phrase config:   "I have (posdet +you) homework"

      internal config: "I have (posdet-1-of-1 +you) homework"
                       "I have (posdet-1-of-2 +you) (posdet-2-of-2 +you) homework"

      user input:      "I have yall's homework"

      tokenized:       "I have yall 's homework"

  I do not forsee having a use for non-precomputable multi-word expressions.

* Destuttering: Make it work on canonically equivalent code point sequences.
  Can't solve it by just NFC normalization, have to take combining diacritical
  marks into account.  Also do NFC normalization before calling it.
