# List of single-token reduced forms -> list of normalized forms.
#
# Notes:
# * Data is not case-sensitive.
# * Contractions are OK, but they must be tokenized.
# * If there are multiple mormalized options, they must be the same number of
#   tokens.
# * Tags are required if they different between normalized options (eg, getcha
#   -> get you/PRP, get your/PRP$).
# * If no tag is provided, the tag will be provided automatically by the tagger.
#   This happens by taking the first untagged word, or if there are none, the
#   first word, from each Token, tagging that sequence, and applying those tags
#   to the rest of the words in each Token.
